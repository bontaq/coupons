Exploring where haskell is at from a production ready standpoint

Effects: fused-effects (used by github for its semantics project)
Server: wai (performance on par with nginx)
Logging: fast-logger (logging that scales with multiple cores, supports files & rotation)
Migrations: Liquibase (I didn't love the options out there)
Testing: hspec (standard)
